Stack Example

**What causes a Stack Overflow?**

The most-common cause of stack overflow is excessively deep or infinite recursion, in which a function calls itself so many times that the space needed to store the variables and information associated with each call is more than can fit on the stack.

**What is a 'reference error'?**

This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.

**What is a 'syntax error'?**

This occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.

**What is a 'range error'?**

Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.

**What is a 'type error'?**

this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.

**What is a breakpoint?**

Is the point that you want to stop your code

**What does the word 'debugger' do in your code?**

It stops the execution
