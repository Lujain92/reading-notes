## O(1)
 describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

 ## O(N)
 describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set

 ## O(N²)
 represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

 ## O(2^N)
 denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set

 ## Logarithms O(log N) 
 a growth curve that peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase e.g. an input data set containing 10 items takes one second to complete, a data set containing 100 items takes two seconds.
