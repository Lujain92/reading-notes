# Linear Regression

**used to model the relationship between two variables and estimate the value of a response by using a line-of-best-fit.**
## types:
1. Simple Linear Regression
Simple or single-variate linear regression is the simplest case of linear regression, as it has a single independent variable.

2. Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple or multivariate linear regression is a case of linear regression with two or more independent variables.

3. Polynomial Regression

**the imlementing done using numpy, scipy, stats model and sckit learn.**
## Steps for Implementing Linear Regression

1. Import libraries, data and clean it.

2. Explore data and rename columns as desired.

3. Explore data set using .DESCR.

4. Use Scikit learn to fit linear regression to the entire data set and calculated the mean squared error.

5. Make a train-test split and calculated the mean squared error for my training data and test data.

6. Plot the residuals for my training and test datasets.
