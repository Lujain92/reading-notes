# Serverless
**Serverless is a cloud computing application development and execution model that enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure.**

### Serverless is more than just FaaS
**in addition it has :**
* Serverless databases and storage: Databases (SQL and NoSQL) and storage (particularly object storage) are the foundation of the data layer. A serverless approach to these technologies involves transitioning away from provisioning “instances” with defined capacity, connection and query limits, and moving toward models that scale linearly with demand in both infrastructure and pricing.

* Event streaming and messaging: Serverless architectures are well-suited for event-driven and stream-processing workloads most notably the open source Apache Kafka event streaming platform.

* API gateways: API gateways act as proxies to web actions and provide HTTP method routing, client ID and secrets, rate limits, CORS, viewing API usage, viewing response logs, and API sharing policies.

|Pros|Cons|
|----|----|
|Improved developer productivity|Unacceptable latency for certain applications
|Pay for execution only|Higher costs for stable or predictable workloads
|Develop in any language|Monitoring and debugging issues
|Streamlined development/DevOps cycles|Vendor lock-in
|Cost-effective performance|
|Usage visibility|
