# Web Scraping
Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. Web scraping software may directly access the World Wide Web using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.

Scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Once fetched, extraction can take place.


An overarching rule to keep in mind for any kind of web scraping is BE GOOD AND FOLLOW A WEBSITEâ€™S CRAWLING POLICIES

* Respect Robots.txt

* Make the crawling slower, do not slam the server, treat websites nicely

* Do not follow the same crawling pattern

* Make requests through Proxies and rotate them as needed

* Rotate User Agents and corresponding HTTP Request Headers between requests

* Use a headless browser like Puppeteer, Selenium or Playwright

* Beware of Honey Pot Traps

* Check if Website is Changing Layouts

* Avoid scraping data behind a login

* Use Captcha Solving Services
