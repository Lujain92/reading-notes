# Intro to Next.js & Tailwind CSS

## What is Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that enables several extra features, including server-side rendering and generating static websites. Next.js is an open-source web development framework created by Vercel enabling React-based web applications with server-side rendering and generating static websites.

**How to Create a Next app**

```
npx create-next-app@latest <name>
```

**app Directory**

improving the routing and layouts experience in Next.js and aligning with the future of React with the introduction of the app directory. This is a follow-up to the Layouts RFC previously published for community feedback.

The app directory is currently in beta and we do not recommend using it in production yet. You can use Next.js 13 with the pages directory with stable features like the improved next/image and next/link components, and opt into the app directory at your own pace. The pages directory will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future.

The app directory includes support for:

- **Layouts:** Easily share UI between routes while preserving state and avoiding expensive re-renders.
- **Server Components:** Making server-first the default for the most dynamic applications.
- **Streaming:** Display instant loading states and stream in units of UI as they are rendered.
- **Support for Data Fetching:** async Server Components and extended fetch API enables component-level fetching.



You can then define layouts through the file system. Layouts share UI between multiple pages. On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not re-render.



## What is tailwindcss

### Why use tailwindcss

Traditionally, whenever you need to style something on the web, you write CSS. With Tailwind, you style elements by applying pre-existing classes directly in your HTML.


Why not just use inline styles?
A common reaction to this approach is wondering, “isn’t this just inline styles?” and in some ways it is — you’re applying styles directly to elements instead of assigning them a class name and then styling that class.

But using utility classes has a few important advantages over inline styles:

- Designing with constraints. Using inline styles, every value is a magic number. With utilities, you’re choosing styles from a predefined design system, which makes it much easier to build visually consistent UIs.
- Responsive design. You can’t use media queries in inline styles, but you can use Tailwind’s responsive utilities to build fully responsive interfaces easily.
- Hover, focus, and other states. Inline styles can’t target states like hover or focus, but Tailwind’s state variants make it easy to style those states with utility classes.

### Maintainability concerns

The biggest maintainability concern when using a utility-first approach is managing commonly repeated utility combinations.

This is easily solved by extracting components and partials, and using editor and language features like multi-cursor editing and simple loops.

Aside from that, maintaining a utility-first CSS project turns out to be a lot easier than maintaining a large CSS codebase, simply because HTML is so much easier to maintain than CSS. Large companies like GitHub, Netflix, Heroku, Kickstarter, Twitch, Segment, and more are using this approach with great success.
